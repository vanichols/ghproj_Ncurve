## FEM: First plot
ggplot(data = leach2, aes(x = n_rate, y = leaching_kgha, color = year)) +

## Here an important decision is what nonlinear model to use
## Possible options are:
## 1. SSexpf
## 2. SSblin
## 3. SSexplin

fm1 <- nls(leaching_kgha ~ SSexpf(n_rate, a, c), data = leach2)
fm2 <- nls(leaching_kgha ~ SSblin(n_rate, a, b, xs, c), data = leach2)
fm3 <- nlsLM(leaching_kgha ~ SSexplin(n_rate, cm, rm, tb), data = leach2) # what is nlsLM?
## FEM: nlsLM is a version of nls which is more robust than nls. it is in the minpack.lm package

## After looking at the data a bit more it is clear that sc is almost
## linear and cc shows in many cases a 'break-point'. For this reason the 
## blinear model seems a reasonable one

## According to this the blin is the better model
## But not that different from SSexplin
anova(fm1, fm2, fm3)
anova(fm2, fm3)

## This seems like a reasonable model

# FEM: 2020-04-21. I added cropsys here, but one thing I noteice later (it was not obvious at first) is that

## these plots are always VERY informative. plot(fmL) shows the residuals
## from individually fitting a nonlinear model to each 'experimental unit'
## the intervals plot shows that 'c' is varying systematically for different 
## experimental units. 'xs' can be hard to esimate because some units have 
## very large confidence intervals. 'a' and 'b' are likely to vary according to
## factors in the 'design' of this experiment

# GN how are they ordered on the y axis for this?
# ie why is there a trend in the c parm?
# Basically you can tell each eu has a different 'c', 
# while the a and b values look more 'clumpy'?

## The residual variance is mostly ok, but there are some 
## significant outliers, not that many though

# GN - The grouped nature of the original data doesn't matter here, right?
# The 'groups' argument for nlme is to define nesting, right?
## I had to eliminate xs here for this to converge
# GN - how did you know to eliminate xs. Because it's hard to est, based on the above plots?
fmm <- nlme(fmL, random = pdDiag(a + b + c ~ 1))
