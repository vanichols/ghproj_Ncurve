1. Why is Sutherland file notation different? ie why does it include "spring"? Is there a "fall"? If it isn't important can you eliminate it from the name?

2. In Sutherland 1994 the annual_rain, tile drainage, etc. is missing - not the case in all other sites that the first year of sim has missing rain. 
Should that year just be removed completely? Why is it in the sim? Is it part of spin-up?

3. Can you rename all the simulations so they have the same notation?

site_rot_nrate_other
ex: sutherland_cc_0N_spring (only if the spring is important for the sim)
ex: randirag_cc_0N

Most of them are fine, but:
sutherland (has that weird spring inserted?) and 
randirag (has the rotation right after the site name, not separated by underscores)

I separate the file name to get information about the sims automatically. 

4. Can you change the column names to include the units?

ex: leaching_kgha instead of annual_tile_nleaching? Same for tile drainage and nitrate_flow_tile

5. It looks like spin-up years are still included (ex Gentry 1994-1998) in some sites.
Why do some sites include it but others don't? 
How can I know when the acutal simulation data you want me to use starts?

6. The sc and cs rotations are identical. For example in Gentry 1994 is a maize year in the cs rotation AND in the sc rotation. 
I think you want one of those rotatations to start with soybeans. 
You can see this in the QC plots also. 

7. Hoffman yields look very strange. Do you know why?
