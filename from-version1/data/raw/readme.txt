We insituted a date-notation to keep track of data changes. 
What went wrong before this:
Gentry had copy-paste errors
Gold CC 112N was mistakenly copied to Gold CC 168N

(heather)
It should be all fixed now (Lawlor, Huggins, world peace...). 
I put the other data files in a subfolder so you don't get overwhelmed by it all. 
I qc'ed the data and there should no longer be a hump in either the Huggins nor Lawlor data. 
The fit for the Lawlor data is actually still pretty good too.
